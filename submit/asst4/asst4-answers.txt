1. The ELF magic numbers are the first 4 bytes of the ELF file header. They are 0x7F, 'E', 'L', 'F'.  The ELF file header struct is defined in "src/kern/include/elf.h" as "Elf32_Ehdr". THe magic numbers are a way to quickly identify that this is a ELF format file.

2. These flags are defined by an enumeration in "src/kern/include/uio.h". UIO_USERISPACE refers to user process code, and UIO_USERSPACE refers to user process data. It is important to distinguish userspace data from kernel data (marked as UIO_SYSSPACE), since userspace code and data should not be trusted. Specifically, these flags are primarily used in uio.c, where data marked by UIO_SYSSPACE is data only transferred within the kernel and is manipulated using memmove(), while data marked by UIO_USERSPACE/UIO_USERISPACE is manipulated using copyin/copyout.
